# A Plan to make an open source CSS framework which is made by contribution of it users
### Now the first few versions of it will be pretty simple with navbar, cards with flex and css grid, table, forms
### The basic UI color I have choosen is # **steelblue**, aka rgb(70, 130, 180) and also # **red** kind of color aka rgb(235, 18, 54) for form button and border in forms folder 
### Also willing to make a documentation for it as it grows
### Now the code is very small can be read and uderstood
### Make a issue if you find any 
### The next version will come with beautiful cards and till suggest anything more if you wish to on adityaingh27apr@gmail.com and please follow me on github
